Failed Mathematician. I am a postgraduate research student in pure mathematics at the end of my degree and a deep disillusion on the learning of math. 
My mathematical interests are geometric group theory, computational group theory, category theory, homological algebra.
Currently re-learning how to write code. I tutor Haskell + Prolog as part of a declarative programming class targeted at postgraduate computer science students.
