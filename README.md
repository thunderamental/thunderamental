Potential failed Mathematician. I am a postgraduate research student in pure mathematics at the end of my degree and a deep disillusion on the learning of math. 
My mathematical interests are geometric group theory, computational group theory, category theory, homological algebra.
Currently re-learning how to write code. I tutor Haskell + Prolog as part of a declarative programming class targeted at postgraduate computer science students.

My research focus is the study of complexity theory regarding groups for postquantum non-commutative cryptography with platform groups such as the Braid variants, Thompson's F Groups and Grigorchuk's group.

Toward the end of my masters thesis I will be uploading all non-commutative cryptography protocols that are currently being worked on, to a public repository here. Check back at the end of the year to find it.
